Android-Port-Scanner
====================

An Android application for finding all open ports on a give IP address.

This is a full working prototype of a "port scanner" for Android. This port scanner was made with Android Studio and tested on Samsung Galaxy s3.

The app allows user to input a hostname or an IP address and then scan a range of up to 100 ports.

This is the finished application: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.timashton.aportscanner
